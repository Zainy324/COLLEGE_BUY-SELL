# Snack-Stop
campus food delivery platform for IIIT Hyderabad students. Users can sign up, browse canteen menus, add items to their cart, and place orders for delivery to their rooms.

Students can also become delivery partners by accepting and delivering orders, updating delivery status through the app. Orders and user data are managed via a Flask backend connected to an SQLite database.

The frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an easy-to-use interface for ordering, tracking, and managing deliveries.
